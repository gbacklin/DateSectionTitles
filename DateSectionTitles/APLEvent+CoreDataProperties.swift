 Abstract:
 Custom class for the Event entity.
 The timeStamp and title are persistent attributes; the sectionIdentifier is transient and derived from timeStamp.
 * timeStamp is the date on which the event occurred.
 * title is displayed in the table view rows.
 When the default data is created in the application delegate, the title is initialized to a string representation of the date.
 * sectionIdentifier is used to divide the events into sections in the table view.
 sectionIdentifier is a string value representing the number ((year * 1000) + month). Using this value, events can be correctly ordered and grouped regardless of the actual name of the month. It is calculated and cached on demand in the custom accessor method.
